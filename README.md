In this project we have created a static Django website which we have learnt during microservices and we have also used concurrency to reduce the execution time of our project. At first, we have created a python virtual environment and installed django. After this we created a empty django project and thereafter we have made some changes to our files in the project which includes changing the time xones and paths of our files. Now we will start our server, on successfully creating a web page we need a app to get the contents and design of our webpage. In templates folder we create a html file which consists of head,body where we can create our portfolio. After creating a static portfolio website we have hosted it on github and the link is obtained to access our webpage. Our webpage is saved in index.html file which can be accessed to see our website but we will be providing the link which is obtained from hosting our website on github.index.html contains actual contents and portfolio_2 is the page downloaded after creating the page.Screenshots of our website are uploaded below
